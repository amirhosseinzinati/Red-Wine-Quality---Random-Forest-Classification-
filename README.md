# üç∑Red Wine Quality - Random Forest Classificationüç∑
This project is a machine learning application that predicts the quality of red wines based on their physicochemical properties. The dataset used for this task is the Red Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that also available in kaggle from this (link)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009]

The main goal of this project is to train a classification model that can accurately predict the quality of red wines based on their physicochemical properties. To achieve this goal, we used a Random Forest classifier, which is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the predictions.

Our implementation achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test set, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the Random Forest algorithm for this task. We also conducted a detailed analysis of the feature importances to understand the most important factors that contribute to the quality of red wines.

## Project Structure
The repository contains the following files:

wine_quality.csv: the dataset used for training and testing the model.
red-wine-quality-random-forest-classification.ipynb: a Jupyter notebook that contains the code for preprocessing the data, training the Random Forest model, and evaluating its performance.

## Conclusion
In this project, we developed a Random Forest classifier to predict the quality of red wines based on their physicochemical properties. Our implementation achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test set, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the Random Forest algorithm for this task. We hope that this project serves as a useful example for anyone interested in applying machine learning to real-world problems.
